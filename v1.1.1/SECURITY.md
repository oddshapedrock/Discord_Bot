# Security Policy

## Policy

I am very concerned about securtity, and will make it my duty to protect you and your computer.  
No code is perfect, so it will always need updated.  
I will not knowingly leave up code that may prove harmful, or as a gateway for something to your computer.  
None of the code I use should ever have a security problem that affects you personally. (Worst case security problem is leaked API keys)  
All that said if you do notice a security issue report it immediately in the Discord server!

## Supported versions

Versions of code not getting security updates are less likely to be secure, and should try to be avoided.

This is the list of versions still getting security updates -

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v.1.1.1 | :white_check_mark: |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a vulnerability report it in [Discord](https://discord.gg/tG3A2TrQJ3)  
The reports will be checked atleast once a week, and the problem may take a while to resolve  
You will get a message once we have taken action.
